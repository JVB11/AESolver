AE Solver is a computational framework made to estimate the degree of (resonant) non-linear coupling among oscillation modes in oscillating stars.
It is split up in different sub-packages to increase modularity (and ease of future extension).

The exemplary/proof-of-concept science case that makes use of this computational framework is described in detail in [Van Beeck et al. (2024)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/07/aa48369-23/aa48369-23.html), and concerns resonant non-linear coupling among gravito-inertial modes (GIMs) in stellar models typical of slowly pulsating B stars.\
Using such couplings we showed that one of the non-linear observables computed by this framework -- the amplitude ratios of (non-linearly coupled) GIMs -- can aid asteroseismic modeling efforts by incorporation of the (resonant) combination frequencies.
We refer the interested reader to section 5 of [Van Beeck et al. (2024)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/07/aa48369-23/aa48369-23.html) for more details on the potential impact non-linear observables may have in asteroseismic modeling.

The API docs and README descriptions of the sub-packages of the AE Solver framework may be consulted [here](overview_API.md).\
Guidelines for the fair use of this framework are given [here](citation_guidelines.md).
